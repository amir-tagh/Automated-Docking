Convert SMILES to SDF: The script converts SMILES to SDF files in parallel using Open Babel and saves them in the sdf_files directory.
Apply GAFF Force Field: It applies the GAFF force field to these SDF files.
Calculate NPRs: The script calculates NPR1 and NPR2 for each molecule.
Plot NPRs: It plots NPR1 vs NPR2 using Matplotlib.
The SDF files generated during the process are saved in the sdf_files directory for further analysis or reference.
Run the Script:
Execute the script with your input file:

python parallel_npr.py path/to/your/input_file.tsv --num_cpus [#]
